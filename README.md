#Abstract

A metabolic pathway is a series of metabolite modifications caused by a sequence of chemical reactions within a cell that are catalyzed by enzymes. For this study, we considered the Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or Krebs cycle, which is an amphibolic pathway. It serves as a mitochondrial hub for the final steps of oxidative catabolism for carbohydrates, amino acid and fatty acids. Here, we focused on those protein that encode enzymes involved in TCA cycle, which lack a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. These regions, called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), are flexible and can adopt multiple conformations. But they are still poorly characterized Therefore, the objective of this study was to find the IDRs within the proteins encoding for enzymes involved in TCA cycle and understand their function, conservation and evolutionary significance. We also tried to look for the RNA binding capacity of these regions but due to lack of data for the same, we couldnâ€™t reach to any conclusion for binding capacity. The 6 organisms that are considered for this study are selected on the basis that many cellular and molecular processes are conserved across these species so ittranslates to better understanding of human biology and diseases.
